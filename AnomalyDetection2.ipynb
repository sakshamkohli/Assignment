    "The Isolation Forest algorithm detects global outliers by isolating them in a binary tree structure. It works by randomly selecting features and partitioning data points until each outlier is isolated in its own leaf node. Since outliers are less likely to follow the same splitting patterns as normal data points, they end up with shorter paths in the tree, making them easier to isolate. By measuring the number of splits needed to isolate a point, Isolation Forest assigns anomaly scores, with lower scores indicating global outliers."
