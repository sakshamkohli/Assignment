    "Boosting is an ensemble technique in machine learning where multiple weak learners (models that perform slightly better than random guessing) are combined to create a strong learner. It works by training models sequentially, with each subsequent model focusing on the errors made by the previous ones. Popular boosting algorithms include AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), which iteratively improve the model's performance by adjusting the weights of misclassified instances."

Then, for each bootstrap sample, compute the statistic of interest (e.g., mean, median, etc.). Finally, calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval by finding the percentile values of these statistics, typically using the percentile method or the bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) method for more accurate intervals."
