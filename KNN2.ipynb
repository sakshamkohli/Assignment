    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN lies in how they calculate distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Euclidean Distance: It measures the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space, using the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding coordinates.\n",
    "- Manhattan Distance: It calculates distance as the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding coordinates of two points along each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This difference can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sensitivity to Outliers: Euclidean distance is sensitive to outliers because it considers the squared differences, while Manhattan distance is less affected by outliers due to its use of absolute differences.\n",
    "- Feature Scaling Impact: Euclidean distance is impacted by feature scaling, where features with larger magnitudes can dominate the distance metric. Manhattan distance is less sensitive to feature scaling as it focuses on absolute differences.\n",

    "Choosing the appropriate distance metric depends on the data characteristics and the problem at hand."

    "- Cross-Validation: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Train the KNN model with different k values on the training set and evaluate performance on the validation set using metrics like accuracy (for classification) or mean squared error (for regression). Choose the k value that gives the best performance on the validation set.\n",
    "- Grid Search: Define a range of k values to explore. Use grid search to exhaustively evaluate the model with each k value using cross-validation. Grid search optimizes hyperparameters like k by searching through the specified range and selecting the best-performing k value based on a chosen evaluation metric."
